      <p> <em>Participants in Slammers Beach Volleyball play at their own risk. Anyone playing is responsible for their own safety and should only play if they are capable. Check with your doctor before you begin.
Game fees must be paid prior to the start of the game. Games may be cancelled by players up to 4 hours before hand to get a refund. Without 4 hours' notice, participants will forfeit the game and be charged 50% of the game fee.
</p></em>

<p>The team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise.
The best of three or best of five games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap).
